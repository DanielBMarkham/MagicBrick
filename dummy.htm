            The long-delayed meeting of North Korea&rsquo;s ruling Worker&rsquo;s Party has
            finally taken place, at a time of severe tension between North Korea and the international
            community. As was widely expected, Kim Jong-il&rsquo;s third son, Kim Jong-eun,
            was appointed to key positions that publicly assert his status as his father&rsquo;s
            successor. The reshuffling of important positions within the party will allow the
            presumed heir to form a new power base.<br />
            <p class='articletext' align='justify'>
                Regardless of whether the young Kim becomes the new leader, North Korea most likely
                faces an unstable future. The cost of maintaining internal order will continue to
                rise as the system&rsquo;s fundamental defects force the new leader to confront
                stark new challenges. Moreover, responsibility for managing that potential instability
                extends far beyond the leadership in Pyongyang.<br />
                <p class='articletext' align='justify'>
                    North Korea&rsquo;s fragility is suggested by the fact that even such an important
                    political event as the Worker&rsquo;s Party conference, held for the first time
                    in three decades, was abruptly postponed earlier in September. One cause for the
                    delay could be a schism within the ruling elite, a group that &ldquo;Dear Leader&rdquo;
                    Kim Jong-il himself cannot control as effectively as before. Moreover, Kim&rsquo;s
                    health problems might have worsened much faster than outsiders guess, further complicating
                    matters.<br />
                    <p class='articletext' align='justify'>
                        &ldquo;Enough is enough,&rdquo; a mid-level North Korean government official recently
                        uttered in a private conversation with a South Korean visitor to Pyongyang regarding
                        Kim Jong-eun&rsquo;s likely succession. Ordinary North Koreans, too, evidently seem
                        to view this succession differently from that of Kim Jong-il&rsquo;s inheritance
                        of power from his father, Kim Il-sung.<br />
                        <p class='articletext' align='justify'>
                            Moreover, there is no hope that any new leader will get any breathing space to establish
                            unquestioned control, given the economy&rsquo;s utter state of decay, as last year&rsquo;s
                            failed bid to reform the currency demonstrated. The regime is under growing pressure
                            from those at the bottom of North Korean society, and recognizes its own inability
                            to handle the situation. For example, for the first time, North Korea&rsquo;s prime
                            minister publicly apologized for a policy error &ndash; the failure of the currency
                            redenomination.<br />
                            <p class='articletext' align='justify'>
                                For the dynamics of the relationship between North Korea&rsquo;s people and its
                                rulers seems to be changing fundamentally. One troubling aspect of this change is
                                that the new leader may feel the need to resort to brute force more frequently in
                                order to suppress popular resistance. And, at a time of domestic hardship and diplomatic
                                isolation, North Korea&rsquo;s leaders, their confidence boosted by their possession
                                of nuclear weapons, might try to distract their public through audacious, and possibly
                                destructive, acts abroad. The attack on the South Korean naval ship Cheonan earlier
                                this year may be a grim sign of things to come.<br />
                                <p class='articletext' align='justify'>
                                    Indeed, the North Korean threat nowadays derives more from the regime&rsquo;s internal
                                    weaknesses than from its aggressive external posture &ndash; the latter being the
                                    authorities&rsquo; fearful response to the former. Unfortunately, however, most
                                    international efforts have sought to ameliorate the symptoms rather than cure the
                                    underlying disease.

                                        Of course, in order to pressure North Korea&rsquo;s government to give up its nuclear
                                        option, the current international economic sanctions, which target weapons of mass
                                        destruction-related products and luxury goods, probably should continue. But, at
                                        the same time, the international community should place greater emphasis on policies
                                        aimed at inducing North Korea to launch serious economic reform.<br />
                                        <p class='articletext' align='justify'>
                                            At a time of increased tension between North Korea, South Korea, and the United
                                            States such a policy may seem impossible to undertake. Yet a road map for a peaceful
                                            transition can be designed.<br />
                                            <p class='articletext' align='justify'>
                                                If, say, North Korea is willing to respect international standards of economic behavior,
                                                it could be invited to join the International Monetary Fund. Western governments
                                                also could permit charitable foundations to provide North Korean officials or students
                                                with scholarships to study abroad and learn how to run a market economy. Of course,
                                                any assistance to North Korea would have to be monitored closely to prevent it from
                                                being diverted for military or other political purposes.<br />
                                                <p class='articletext' align='justify'>
                                                    The international community would lose nothing by trying this approach and testing
                                                    the regime&rsquo;s will to reform. In fact, following the recent currency fiasco,
                                                    North Korean leaders may have become more open to economic reform than ever before.
                                                    Such an approach is also compatible with Chinese policy, which has been to pressure
                                                    North Korea to adopt its model of economic reform.<br />
                                                    <p class='articletext' align='justify'>
                                                        To be sure, North Korea&rsquo;s regime is not the only obstacle to international
                                                        engagement. Conservatives in both the United States and South Korea may argue that
                                                        North Korea must first move toward denuclearization before any kind of economic
                                                        assistance is offered.<br />
                                                        <p class='articletext' align='justify'>
                                                            But there is no reason why international efforts to ensure North Korea&rsquo;s denuclearization
                                                            must preclude policies aimed at bringing about domestic reform. We need not assume
                                                            that these goals cannot be pursued simultaneously. On the contrary, it may be impossible
                                                            to win North Korea&rsquo;s assent to denuclearization in the absence of far-reaching
                                                            domestic change.
